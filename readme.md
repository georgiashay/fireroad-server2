# FireRoad Server

FireRoad is an iOS (and hopefully soon, web) application providing MIT students
with accessible information about courses, subjects, and schedules. The FireRoad
Server is a Django server that currently provides simple catalog auto-updating
services but is intended to expand into course suggestion features later on.

The `master` branch of this repo is intended to be checked out and run by the
production server. All changes not ready for `master` should be kept in the
`develop` branch.
