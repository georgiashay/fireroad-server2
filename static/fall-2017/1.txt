Building on the skills and relationships acquired in the Engineering Practice Workshop, students receive coaching to articulate goals, invoke the UPOP network of mentors and employers, identify and pursue opportunities and negotiate terms of their summer assignment. Students complete a 10-12 week internship, which includes filing three progress reports, conducting one informational interview, and possibly hosting a site visit by MIT staff. Returning to campus as juniors, UPOP students take part in reflective exercises that aid assimilation of learning objectives and reinforce the cognitive link between all aspects of the UPOP experience and disciplinary fields of study.
