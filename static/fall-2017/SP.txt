The program includes calculus; chemistry; physical education; physics; writing, oral presentation and teamwork skills; and supporting academic activities, including small-group learning. Students can earn transcript credit for subjects taken in the program, sometimes resulting in advanced placement in corresponding subjects taken in the Fall. Activities include day trips to area cultural, recreational, and business sites.

The meeting time is set by the XL facilitator based on students' schedules.",,,,,Y,,,,,"L. Uchima, S. Kalloo",
