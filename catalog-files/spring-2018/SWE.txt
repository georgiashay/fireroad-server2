"SWE.006",,"U",2,1,3,6,,,,"",,"Project-based seminar in innovative design thinking develops students' ability to conceive, implement, and evaluate successful projects in any engineering discipline. Lectures focus on the iterative design process and techniques to enhance creative analysis. Students use this process to design and implement robust voice recognition applications using a simple web-based system. They also give presentations and receive feedback to sharpen their communication skills for high emotional and intellectual impact. Guest lectures illustrate multidisciplinary approaches to design thinking.",,,,,Y,,Y,,,"Fall:  C. Kotelly\nSpring:  C. Kotelly",,"http://student.mit.edu/catalog/mSWEa.html#SWE.006"
