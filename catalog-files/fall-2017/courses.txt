The program has a dual focus: it gives students an introduction to the MIT experience by exposing them to the rigors of a full subject load while simultaneously preparing them for academic success beyond MIT. The program includes calculus; chemistry; physical education; physics; writing, oral presentation and teamwork skills; and supporting academic activities, including small-group learning. Students can earn transcript credit for subjects taken in the program, sometimes resulting in advanced placement in corresponding subjects taken in the Fall. Activities include day trips to area cultural, recreational, and business sites.
